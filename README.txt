Instructions to run the code:
make

The makefile contains two variables, NUM_SHINGLES and NUM_DOCUMENTS, which
indicate number of shingles and number of documents respectively.

Alternatively, simply executing 'python main.py <num_documents> <num_shingles>'
on the terminal will execute the code.

It takes approximately 2 hours to run completely on the stdlinux server, for
17,500 documents and num_shingles = 1 or 2 or 3.

Compatible with Python 2.6 only
