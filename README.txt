The output files are stored in data/output directory. The feature matrices are
stored in word_freq_matrix.mtx, bigram_matrix and tf_idf_matrix.mtx which can be

***Caution: Preferably use a very light weight editor or the head command for
viewing bigram features and bigram matrices. Gvim hangs for a few seconds on
opening these files, however it works normally after that.****
