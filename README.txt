In parser script , I tested for 2 sample .sgm file with 2 reuters tag in each file. 
You can change the path to point to reuters folder and then run it. 
There is slight issue in it. I am storing each tag like places, topic etc in list. There is separate lists for places and topics as they can be many. These two lists are not updating correctly. You will find the topics and places or first reuters tag is repeated everywhere. 
This thing need to be changed. Other than this. I think it will run fine in cse servers.
